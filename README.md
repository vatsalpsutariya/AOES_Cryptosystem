# AOES_Cryptosystem

- This is the repository for a new cryptosystem project namely Advanced Onion Encryption Standard (AOES).
- For now this implementation is just for educational purposes.
- I have attached the source code along with some documentation on how AOES is intended to work and analysis of this cryptosystem
- This repository is now archived for public view and more changes are to be done in future regarding additional functionalities to the system.
- To run the web-app simply go with "npm run start" and enjoy :)
